    "## Description \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to train an agent to pick up yellow bananas and avoid blue ones in an ML-Unity environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to navigate the environment, I built and trained a DQN agent. The relevant code can be found in `dqn_agent.py`and `model.py`in the same directory as this notebook. What follows is a brief description of the implementation techniques and the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Target network with Polyak updating\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to fix the target network when evaluating experiences to improve training stability. In practice, we keep two sets of parameters: $\\theta_{local}$ and $\\theta_{target}$). Instead of copying the parameters $\\theta_{local}$ into $\\theta_{target}$ every $N$ steps, we use Polyak updating, i.e. interpolation, with parameter $\\tau = 10^{-3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def polyak_update(self, local_model, target_model):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Soft update model parameters.\n",
    "    θ_target = τ*θ_local + (1 - τ)*θ_target\n",
    "\n",
    "    Params\n",
    "    ======\n",
    "        local_model (PyTorch model): weights will be copied from\n",
    "        target_model (PyTorch model): weights will be copied to\n",
    "        tau (float): interpolation parameter \n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    for target_param, local_param in zip(target_model.parameters(), local_model.parameters()):\n",
    "        target_param.data.copy_(self.tau * local_param.data + (1.0 - self.tau) * target_param.data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Experience replay with importance sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "If we just feed our training network with the experiences in the same order as we gather them, the samples would be highly correlated. This correlation can be problematic for several reasons, e.g. concentrating in suboptimal actions while ignoring other promising ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decorrelate the experiences we keep a FIFO buffer of $N=10^5$ entries, and during training, we sample them randomly in batches of $Batch_{size}=128$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it has been shown that sampling the most informative experiences more often helps with the training. For each experience, we assign a priority $w_i$ equal to the absolute error of the expected and the actual value of $Q(a \\mid s)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_i = \\frac {(w_i + \\varepsilon)^\\eta}{\\sum_j{(wj + \\varepsilon)^\\eta}}, \n",
    "\\varepsilon = 0.0001 , \\eta = 0.5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, oversampling some experiences has an effect on the learned distribution. Therefore, we have to scale down the losses according to the experience weight. This effect is only noticiable in the last stages of the training, There is a parameter $\\beta = 1.0$ that we can change during training and controls the magnitude of the scaling down.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Compute loss and scale it according to the priority weight\n",
    "loss = F.mse_loss(q_expected, q_targets, reduce=False)\n",
    "loss /= (len(self.memory) * weights) ** self.priority_weight_beta\n",
    "loss = loss.mean()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Double DQN\n",
    "\n",
    "The vanilla DQN algorithm overestimates $Q$ values as it uses $\\arg\\max$ of the actions. In order to calculate an unbiased estimation, we use two different networks: one to find the $\\arg\\max_{a'_i} {Q(s,a'_i)}$, and other to calculate the value of this particular state-action. The good news is that we don't need to create a new network, as we can use the $Q_{local}$ network for finding the action, and the $Q_{target}$ to calculate the $Q$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get max predicted Q values for next states using Double DQN\n",
    "q_targets_next_actions = self.qnetwork_local(next_states).detach().argmax(1, keepdim=True)\n",
    "q_targets_next = self.qnetwork_target(next_states).detach().gather(1, q_targets_next_actions)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Duel network\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can make our DQN's life easier building two different regression networks for the *state-value* and the *advantages* (i.e. the deviation from the state-value for each action). Unfortunately, we just cannot naïvely apply a linear combination of both output streams to calculate the $Q$-value, as we would lose the identity of each stream. We can enforce the identity of the combining streams by substracting the mean value, or the maximum value, from the advantages, this way any common offset from the advantages is cancelled and has to be learned in the state-value stream. The implementation uses the mean as it works well even if it diverges from the definition of $Q$-value (i.e. max action value)\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of this technique is that it only requires changes in the NN model `model.py`. The final network consists only of lineal units with ReLU non-linearities:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class QNetwork(nn.Module):\n",
